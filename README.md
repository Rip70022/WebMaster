# WebMaster

# Description
WebMaster is a simple Bash and Python script that allows users to copy the HTML content from a specified webpage. It checks for the necessary dependencies (Python 3 and the requests module) and installs them if they're missing. This tool is useful for web scraping and HTML retrieval.

# Features:
- Dependency checks for Python 3 and the `requests` module.
- Colorful terminal banner displaying the application name and author.
- Prompts for a URL and a filename to save the HTML content.
- Interactive shell prompt with the ability to exit the script.

# Requirements:
- Bash shell
- Python 3
- `requests` module (automatically installed if missing)

# Usage:
